# Python Data Validation Example with Great Expectations

This project demonstrates how to use Python for data validation using the Great Expectations library.

Great Expectations is an open-source Python library for data validation, documentation, and profiling.
It helps data teams eliminate pipeline debt, through data testing, documentation, and profiling.
With Great Expectations, you can assert what you expect from your data, and automatically catch data issues as they emerge.
